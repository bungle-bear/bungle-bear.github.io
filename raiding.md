# Savage Raiding for Beginners #

I'm fairly new to savage raiding,
having started properly only in the most recent raid tier, Alphascape.
But I've quickly found that I enjoy it immensely.
It is by far my favourite thing to do in the whole game.
I've sunk hours and hours into raiding,
both in my static, Sweet Moves,
and in "PUG" parties formed using Party Finder.
And I keep coming back for more.
Although I feel that I've learned a lot about raiding,
I still wouldn't consider myself an expert.
Nonetheless, I hope that I'm in a good position to give some advice
to beginners, since I recently was one myself.
This is what I'll try to do below.

The main topics I'll cover are the following:

1. Reasons for Raiding
2. Mechanics
3. Your rotation
4. Evaluating your performance
5. Some brief advice for healers
6. Group Coordination

## Reasons for Raiding ##

As with most other content in the game,
players may have different reasons for raiding.
They may be trying to achieve different goals.
At the more "casual" end of the spectrum,
some players are content merely to be able to successfully "clear" raids.
For these players,
the main focus may be simply learning mechanics (see the next session).
At the opposite end of the spectrum,
more serious or "hardcore" raiders aim to achieve more than this.
They want to clear raids as quickly and efficiently as possible.
They strive to optimise their performance and maximise their DPS.
(These are the guys going after "orange parses" on FFLogs.)
These players will focus not only on mechanics
but also on perfecting their rotation (see the section after next).
And many players will fall somewhere in the middle of this spectrum.

Of course, there is no single "right" way to approach raiding.
As long as you enjoy what you're doing, that's completely fine in my book.
But this may be relevant for the advice I give below.
If you're happy to take a more casual approach,
then some of the advice in later sections may be less applicable to you.

## Mechanics ##

You're probably already familiar with "mechanics" from other content,
like dungeons, trials, or normal raids.
These are basically events that occur during an encounter
which require a reaction of some sort from the players.
This might be, for example, a simple orange circle on the ground
indicating that bad things will soon happen in the designated area.
Players should react by moving elsewhere.
Mechanics in savage raids tend to be a lot more complicated,
often requiring precise coordination between players.
Strategies are adopted,
assigning roles or positions to players,
and success depends on everyone executing their own part of the "strat" correctly.
Sometimes you need to react quickly to a random event.
For example, players may be randomly inflicted with various debuffs,
and the appropriate action depends on who has which debuff.

The complexity of mechanics means that you need to *learn* a raid.
Like other encounters in this game,
savage raids are highly scripted.
The mechanics occur in a predictable order at predictable times.
You can partially learn a fight by consulting a guide.
But the best way to learn a raid is just by doing it,
over and over again.
I can think of many mechanics which at first seemed very difficult
but later became largely trivial after lots of practise.
Learning a raid is usually an incremental affair.
At first, you might barely be able to get past the first few mechanics.
Then after a while,
you become comfortable with these and start working on the next set of mechanics.
Raids can generally be divided in to several distinct phases.
You will often be in the position of being able to do, say,
the first two phases, but still need to practise the third.
(If you're going to join a party in Party Finder for the purpose
of learning a raid, then please ensure that you only join appropriate parties.
Don't join a party that is practising the second phase
if you're still not comfortable with the first.
People who do this kind of thing are very bad.)

Another thing you can do to help with mechanics
is to pay careful attention to the information provided in the game's HUD.
Most important is the boss's "cast bar".
This is displayed as a component of the "target information"
when you have the boss targeted.
By default it's located at the top of the screen,
but this can be customised.
You can make it larger, or move it to somewhere more prominent.
The cast bar tells you what's coming next.
This is often your best cue for the incoming mechanics.
You should get into the habit of frequently glancing at the boss's cast bar.
(If you're a healer, you can set the boss as your "focus target",
so you can still see what he's going to do
even when you have to target another player for healing.)
This will also help you to learn the names of the various abilities
used by the boss during the raid,
which is useful for discussing strategy with other players.
Another good source of information is the party list,
which shows, among other things, any debuffs that players have.
Some raids may have an "add" phase
where additional enemies enter the fight.
Some even have more than one boss.
In these cases,
it's helpful to look at the "enemy list",
which shows cast bars for all the enemies.
This is useful because obviously you cannot have more than one enemy
targeted at a time.

The key skills here are being *observant*, paying attention to what's going on,
and *thinking ahead* to what's coming next,
so you're not caught off guard by an unexpected mechanic.
A lot of raiding is about *positioning*,
being in the right place at the right time.
If you anticipate where you'll need to be for the next mechanic,
you're less likely to find yourself in the wrong place.
And, as I've stressed above,
to be able to anticipate mechanics, you have to learn the fight.

## Your Rotation ##

Merely being able to successfully negotiate all the mechanics of a raid
is not sufficient to guarantee success.
All raids have an "enrage".
After a certain time (usually around ten minutes),
the boss will cast a lethal attack that is impossible to survive.
If you haven't killed the boss by this time,
then you've failed.
It's time to start again from the beginning.
This means that your raid party must collectively
output a certain minimum amount of damage, or "DPS" (Damage Per Second),
in order to clear.
Just staying alive by doing all the mechanics correctly
is no good if you don't do enough damage at the same time.
(Side note: in FFXIV, by design, all jobs are expected to contribute DPS,
including healers.)

That's easy, you might think.
Dealing damage is just a matter of using your abilities.
But it's not as simple as that.
Your abilities can be used in more or less effective ways,
and this can make a huge difference to your DPS.
Some abilities do more damage
when they are used after other abilities ("combos").
Some abilities do more damage when used from a certain direction
relative to the target ("positionals").
Some abilities deliver damage in increments over a period of time
and therefore need to be "refreshed" at regular intervals ("DoTs").
Doing optimal DPS means, roughly, using your abilities in the right order.
This is commonly referred to as your "rotation".

How well you execute your rotation is a central factor
in determining your DPS.
But it should be noted that it is not the *only* factor.
Also relevant, among other things (e.g. raid buffs),
is the level of your gear (weapon and armour).
Consequently,
it is not really true that you need to master your rotation in order to clear raids.
Over time, you will acquire better and better gear.
Eventually you may have gear so powerful that you can clear a raid
merely by doing the mechanics, without worrying much about your rotation.
If you have a fairly casual approach to raiding (see above),
then this may be good enough for you.
But I'm going to assume that you want to do better than this,
that you want to be able to clear raids without relying on being "over-geared".
To achieve this, you *will* need to work on your rotation.

An important part of mastering your rotation
is simply *understanding* all your abilities.
What exactly do they do?
What effects do they have?
How potent are they?
What do they cost, in terms of resources like MP or TP?
What are their cast times and recast times?
An important distinction here is between abilities that are
"on" or "off" the global cooldown (GCD or oGCD).
How do different abilities work together?
With all this information,
you can start to see what a good rotation might be.
But there's no need to reinvent the wheel.
For all jobs, clever people have already worked out the optimal rotation(s).
You can benefit from this work by looking up a guide for your job.

However, that's still not enough.
Merely knowing your rotation is one thing;
being able to consistently execute it in a raid is quite another.
Remember, you're going to have your hands full
dealing with all the tricky mechanics being thrown at you (see above).
And the first rule of optimisation is the "ABC" rule: Always Be Casting!
You should be constantly keeping your global cooldown "rolling",
with no pauses between GCDs.
When you need to use an oGCD, you should ideally "weave" this.
(I won't go into the details of weaving here.
But it's a central concept in DPS optimisation,
so I'd advise you to learn about it if you need to.)
Maintaining a solid rotation *while at the same time*
doing mechanics is where savage raiding really gets hard.

One part of the difficulty is that doing mechanics requires your *attention*.
You need to *think* about what you're doing.
This means you'll have little time to stop and think about what
comes next in your rotation.
So you need to be able to do this more or less automatically,
without thinking about it.
Developing the necessary "muscle memory" simply takes practise.
If you're not feeling comfortable with your rotation,
then I'd recommend practising against a striking dummy
or in less demanding content (like normal raids).
Learning and practising a raid (see above), is also helpful here,
because it reduces the amount mental resources you need to devote to doing mechanics.

Another part of the difficulty is that doing mechanics requires *movement*.
Doing your rotation while standing in one place is easy enough.
But mechanics generally force you to move.
For "casters",
this is difficult because abilities with non-zero cast times
simply cannot be used while moving.
For melee classes, this is difficult
because they may be forced out of melee range,
or prevented from being in position to use their positionals.
Learning a raid can be helpful here too.
With repeated practise,
you'll get to see at what stage of your rotation various mechanics occur.
You can then make small adjustments to your rotation in order to accommodate this.
You can also develop some general strategies for dealing with movement.
For example, Black Mages can use Triple Cast,
all casters can use Swiftcast, Scholars can use Ruin II and Energy Drain, and so on.

## Evaluating Your Performance ##

You can't learn or improve without feedback.
Merely practising a lot will not do you any good
unless you have some way of knowing what you're doing right,
and more importantly what you're doing wrong,
so you can take steps to fix these problems.
In the case of mechanics, you'll get pretty immediate feedback.
If you did it wrong, then you (or someone else) will probably be dead.
In the case of your rotation, however, feedback is less immediate.
This can be hard to assess during the fight itself.
In the heat of battle, many mistakes can go unnoticed.
The only reliable way to evaluate your performance
is by using a tool called ACT (Advanced Combat Tracker).
This basically records all the events that occur during a fight,
and then generates various useful statistics.
It can tell your DPS, or your HPS (Healing Per Second),
how much damage you took and from which attacks,
what buffs and debuffs you had at which times,
and so on.
These records, called "parses" or "logs",
can be uploaded to a website, [FFLogs](https://fflogs.com), 
which maintains a large database of logs.
You can use this to compare your own logs with those of other players on the same job.
There's another website, [xivanalysis.com](http://xivanalysis.com),
which provides automated feedback on logs.
I've found this to be quite helpful.
But you may gain more insight by carefully studying your own logs,
or by showing them to an expert.
(You need to be playing on PC to install ACT.
So if you're on PS4, it would be advisable to raid with a friend on PC
who can record your logs for you.)

I can't stress this enough:
if you want to be a serious raider, then ACT is an essential tool.
There is simply no other way to know how well you are performing.
You cannot merely rely on how things *seem* or *feel* to you during raids.
For example, when I first looked at my own logs,
it became glaringly obvious that I was hardly satisfying the ABC rule.
My CPM (Casts Per Minute) was much lower than it should have been.
Although it *felt* to me as if I was going flat out during the fight,
casting about as quickly as I possibly could,
my logs showed that there were actually lots small unnecessary gaps between my casts.
There were also periods where I stopped casting entirely,
presumably in order to focus on mechanics.
I hadn't even been aware that I was doing this.
Possessed with this knowledge, I was then able to focus on improving my CPM.
That's just one small example.
Even now, although I'm basically competent at my job
(I guess I could be considered above average),
when I look at my logs, I still see lots of mistakes and things I could improve.

## Some Brief Advice for Healers ##

So far I've mainly only discussed DPS.
I've not said anything about the more specialised roles, tanks and healers.
Unfortunately, I'm not qualified to advise on tanking.
But, as a "healer main", I can give a few words of advice on this.

First, as noted above,
FFXIV is simply not designed for full-time healing.
Given the amount of damage that enemies do,
and the potency of your healing toolkit,
it is simply not necessary to spend all your time healing.
Optimal healing is about providing the necessary healing
in the most efficient way possible,
leaving as much time and resources to devote to doing damage.

Second, you have a variety of healing abilities in your toolkit.
These do different things and have different strengths and weaknesses.
Optimal healing is about using the right healing tool for the job.
As with your DPS rotation,
it's essential to understand all your healing abilities.
As a general rule, oGCD heals are better than GCD heals
(they are more potent and have less cost).
You should try to cover as much healing as possible with oGCDs.
But these have longer cooldowns and will not always be available
when healing is needed.
So you will sometimes have to resort to using GCDs.
Planning ahead can help you to ensure that you use your oGCDs
at the best times, to maximise their effectiveness.

Third, good healing is always *preemptive*.
You shouldn't simply be waiting for damage to happen
and then healing afterwards.
(This is true even for White Mages,
who are sometimes erroneously described as "reactive" healers.)
Rather, you should always be thinking ahead to what damage is coming next.
This determines how much healing you need to do now.
If your party is currently at low health
but will not take any more damage for another thirty seconds,
then there's no urgency to heal them up quickly.
In this situation it would be better to use a "regen" or "HoT"
(healing over time),
because these are more efficient,
in the sense that they provide more healing for less cost.
For this reason,
it is especially important for healers to know a raid inside out.
You need to know how much damage is coming and when,
so you can plan your healing accordingly.
Related to this,
it's important to get out of the mindset
of thinking that everyone needs to at 100% health at all times.
This just isn't true.
Players only need health in order to survive damage.
There are times when you know that a player will not be taking
any damage for a while.
So even if they are currently at low health,
healing them can wait until after you've attended to more important matters
(like doing DPS).

Fourth, healing during "progression",
when your party is still learning a raid,
should be more conservative.
Players will inevitably make mistakes
and take damage that they could have avoided.
It's not acceptable to simply let them die
and then blame them for failing the mechanics.
Even if you're not the one at fault,
you will serve your party and yourself better
if you do what you can to keep them alive,
even if this mean healing in a sub-optimal way.

I could go on and on, but tha't probably enough for starters.

## Group Coordination ##

The advice I've given so far is only about your own personal performance.
But raiding is essentially a *group* activity.
Success is about working together as a team.
In my view, this is a large part of what makes raiding so much fun.
When you start to feel comfortable with your own rotation,
you'll want to start thinking about ways in which you can synnergise
your abilities with those of other players in your party.
If you're a healer, you'll have a co-healer;
and if you're a tank, you'll have a co-tank.
Learning how to coordinate your healing or tanking with your partner
is another important aspect of successful raiding.
Many jobs have abilities which provide "raid buffs".
These may provide benefits for everyone in the party,
not just for the player who uses them.
Raids buffs are most effective when they are well coordinated.
So this provides another avenue for group coordination.

I won't go into more detail here,
because some of these topics are too advanced for a beginners' guide.
The point I want to make is that,
because raiding is a group activity,
it can be much more enjoyable and rewarding in the context of a "static",
at least this has been the case in my own experience.
A static is simply a group of players who raid together on a regular basis.
Statics typically communicate with each other by voice chat (e.g. Discord)
while they are raiding.
This makes coordinating strategies and actions much easier.
Voice chat also enables players to "call out" the upcoming mechanics,
so it's less likely that one guy will forget what he's supposed to be doing.
And by playing with the same group of people regularly,
you can develop stable strategies.
You're not constantly having to start again from scratch.
Finally, being in a static has a nice social aspect to it as well.
Raiding needn't be super serious all the time.
You can have fun too.

Again, I don't want to insist that this is the only way to raid
or that it's right for everybody.
You may feel more comfortable going it alone with PUGs in Party Finder.
This is a completely viable approach too.
When it goes well,
it's pretty amazing how well a group of players can coordinate
with only minimal communication.
Unfortunately, it often doesn't go well.
So if you take the PF route, you should be prepared
for a certain amount of frustration.

## Conclusion ##

Okay, that's all I've got for now.
I hope someone will find this advice useful.
And I hope that others might come to enjoy savage raiding as much as I do.
