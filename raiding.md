# FFXIV Savage Raiding for Beginners #

I'm fairly new to savage raiding,
having started properly only in the most recent raid tier, Alphascape.
But I've quickly found that I enjoy it immensely.
It's by far my favourite thing to do in the whole game.
I've sunk many hours into raiding,
both in my static, Sweet Moves, and in "PUGs".
And I keep coming back for more.
Although I've learned a lot about raiding,
I still wouldn't consider myself an expert.
Nonetheless,
I hope I'm in a good position to give some advice to beginners,
since I recently was one myself.
This is what I aim to do below.

I'll discuss the following topics:

## Why Raid? ##

I'm going to assume that you're already basically familiar with raids in FFXIV.
A raid is an encounter in which a party of eight players battles against
a single powerful enemy, called the "boss".
(There may be additional weaker enemies, commonly referred to as "adds",
and occasionally there may be more than one boss.)
To successfully "clear" a raid, you simply have to kill the boss.
Raids come in two levels of difficulty.
Each raid has both a "normal" and a "savage" version.
A savage raid generally has the same setting, same boss,
and many of the same attacks as its normal counterpart.
However, it is considerably more difficult in various ways:
mainly, it has a more demanding DPS requirement, enforced by an "enrage",
and the mechanics are more complicated.
(The game also includes 24-player "Alliance" raids.
I won't be discussing those here.)
If someone describes herself as a "raider", or says that she is "into raiding",
this is normally taken to refer to *savage* raiding.
I'm going to follow this convention below.

So why might you want to get into raiding?
A point I want to emphasise is that,
as with most other content in the game,
players may have different reasons for raiding,
and may be trying to achieve different goals.
At the more "casual" end of the spectrum,
some players are satisfied merely to be able to clear raids.
For these players,
the main focus may be simply learning [mechanics](#mechanics).
At the opposite end of the spectrum,
more serious or "hardcore" raiders aim to achieve more.
They want to clear raids as quickly and efficiently as possible.
They strive to optimise their performance and maximise their DPS.
These players will focus not only on mechanics
but also on perfecting their [rotation](#your-rotation).
And many players will fall somewhere in the middle of this spectrum.

Of course, there is no single "right" way to approach raiding.
As long as you enjoy what you're doing, that's completely fine in my book.
Sadly, you may encounter some elitist raiders who look down upon casuals,
but, as in life generally, you shouldn't pay attention to jerks.
The reason I mention these different approaches here
is that this may be relevant to the advice I give below.
If you're happy to take a casual approach,
some of the advice in later sections may be less applicable to you.

## Mechanics ##

You're probably already familiar with "mechanics" from other content,
like dungeons, trials, or normal raids.
These are basically events that occur during an encounter
which require a reaction of some sort from the players.
This might be, for example, a simple orange circle on the ground
indicating that bad things will soon happen in the designated area.
Players should react by moving elsewhere.
Mechanics in savage raids tend to be a lot more complicated,
often requiring precise coordination between players.
Strategies are adopted,
assigning roles or positions to players,
and success depends on everyone executing their own part of the "strat" correctly.
Sometimes you need to react quickly to a random event.
For example, players may be randomly inflicted with various debuffs,
and the appropriate action depends on who has which debuff.

The complexity of mechanics means that you need to *learn* a raid.
Raids are highly scripted:
the mechanics occur in a predictable order at predictable times.
You can partially learn a raid by consulting a guide.
But the best way is by actually doing the raid, over and over again.
I can recall many mechanics which at first seemed very difficult
but later became trivial after lots of practise.
Learning a raid is usually an incremental affair.
At first, you might barely be able to get past the first few mechanics.
Then after a while,
you become comfortable with these and start working on the next set of mechanics.
Raids can generally be divided in to several distinct phases.
You will often be in the position of being able to do, say,
the first two phases, but still need to practise the third.
(If you use Party Finder, then please only join appropriate parties.
Don't join a party that is practising the second phase
when you're still not comfortable with the first.
If you do this,
you will just be wasting other people's time, which is very selfish.)

A key skill for dealing with mechanics is being *observant*,
paying attention to what's going on.
You need to know what's about to happen so you can react correctly.
Often a mechanic will be initiated by the boss casting an ability.
You can see this by looking at the boss's "cast bar",
which is displayed as a component of the "target bar"
when the boss is targeted.
By default it's located at the top of the screen,
but this can be [customised](https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/uiguide/).
You can make it larger, or move it to somewhere more prominent.
You should get into the habit of frequently glancing at the boss's cast bar.
(If you're a healer, you can set the boss as your "focus target",
so you can still see what he's going to do
even when you have to target another player for healing.)
But you need to be careful here.
Bosses sometimes also have abilities that are not cast,
but instead are indicated by an animation.
The boss will move in some characteristic way before using the ability.
So you need to keep an eye on boss too.
Another good source of information is the party list,
which shows, among other things, any debuffs that players have.
Some raids may have an "add" phase
where additional enemies enter the fight.
Some even have more than one boss.
In these cases,
it's helpful to look at the "enemy list",
which shows cast bars for all the enemies.
This is useful because obviously you cannot have more than one enemy
targeted at a time.
All of this becomes easier after you're learned a raid.
You'll get a sense for where you need to be looking at different times
to get that vital information.

Another important skill is *anticipation*.
You need to be *thinking ahead* to what's coming next,
so you're not caught off guard by an unexpected mechanic.
A lot of raiding is about *positioning*,
being in the right place at the right time.
If you anticipate where you'll need to be for the next mechanic,
you're less likely to find yourself in the wrong place.
Mechanics that involve random events often require you to react *quickly*.
This is harder to do if you have to spend time thinking about the appropriate
reaction *after* the random event has occurred.
It is helpful therefore to mentally prepare for these mechanics:
"The boss about to do either A or B;
if he does A, I'll do X; if he does B, I'll do Y".
Obviously, learning a raid is essential for anticipation.
You need to know the script to anticipate the next act.

## Your Rotation ##

Merely being able to successfully negotiate all the mechanics of a raid
is not sufficient to guarantee success.
All raids have an "enrage".
After a certain time (usually around ten minutes),
the boss will cast a lethal attack that is impossible to survive.
If you haven't killed the boss by this time,
then you've failed.
It's time to start again from the beginning.
This means your party must collectively
output a certain minimum amount of damage, or "DPS" (Damage Per Second),
in order to clear.
Just staying alive by doing all the mechanics correctly
is no good if you don't do enough damage at the same time.
(Side note: in FFXIV, by design, all jobs are expected to contribute DPS,
including healers.)

That's easy, you might think.
Dealing damage is just a matter of using your abilities.
But it's not as simple as that.
Your abilities can be used in more or less effective ways,
and this can make a huge difference to your DPS.
Some abilities do more damage
when they are used after other abilities ("combos").
Some abilities do more damage when used from a certain direction
relative to the target ("positionals").
Some abilities deliver damage in increments over a period of time
and therefore need to be "refreshed" at regular intervals ("DoTs").
Doing optimal DPS means, roughly, using your abilities in the right order.
This is commonly referred to as your "rotation".

How well you execute your rotation is a central factor
in determining your DPS.
But it should be noted that it is not the *only* factor.
Also relevant, among other things (e.g. raid buffs),
is the level of your gear (weapon and armour).
Consequently,
it is not really true that you need to master your rotation in order to clear raids.
Over time, you will acquire better and better gear.
Eventually you may have gear so powerful that you can clear a raid
merely by doing the mechanics, without worrying much about your rotation.
If you have a fairly casual approach to raiding (see above),
then this may be good enough for you.
But I'm going to assume
that you want to be able to clear raids without being "over-geared".
To achieve this, you *will* need to work on your rotation.

An important part of mastering your rotation is *understanding* all your abilities.
What exactly do they do?
What effects do they have?
How potent are they?
What do they cost, in terms of resources like MP or TP?
What are their cast times and recast times?
An important distinction here is between abilities that are
"on" or "off" the global cooldown (GCD or oGCD).
How do different abilities work together?
With all this information,
you can start to see what a good rotation might look like.
But there's no need to reinvent the wheel.
For all jobs, clever people have already worked out the optimal rotation(s).
You can benefit from this work by looking up a guide for your job.

However, that's still not enough.
Merely knowing your rotation is one thing;
being able to consistently execute it in a raid is quite another.
Remember, you're going to have your hands full
dealing with all the tricky mechanics being thrown at you (see above).
And the first rule of optimisation is "ABC": Always Be Casting!
You should be constantly keeping your global cooldown "rolling",
with no pauses between GCDs.
When you need to use an oGCD, you should ideally "weave" this.
(I won't go into the details of weaving here.
But it's a central concept in DPS optimisation,
so I'd advise you to learn about it if you need to.)
Maintaining a solid rotation *while at the same time*
doing mechanics is where savage raiding really gets hard.

One part of the difficulty is that doing mechanics requires your *attention*.
You need to *think* about what you're doing.
This means you'll have little time to stop and think about what
comes next in your rotation.
So you need to be able to do this more or less automatically,
without thinking about it.
Developing the necessary "muscle memory" simply takes practise.
If you're not feeling comfortable with your rotation,
then I'd recommend practising against a striking dummy
or in less demanding content (like normal raids).
Learning and practising a raid (see above), is also helpful here,
because it reduces the amount mental resources you need to devote to doing mechanics.

Another part of the difficulty is that doing mechanics requires *movement*.
Doing your rotation while standing in one place is easy enough.
But mechanics generally force you to move.
For "casters",
this is difficult because you need to stand still to cast many of your spells.
For melee classes,
this is difficult because you may be forced out of melee range
or out of position for your positionals.
Learning a raid can be helpful here too.
With repeated practise,
you'll get to see at what stage of your rotation various mechanics occur.
You can then make small adjustments to your rotation in order to accommodate movement.
You can also develop some general strategies for dealing with this.
For example, Black Mages can use Triple Cast and all casters can use Swiftcast.
These abilities essentially convert spells with cast times
into instant-cast spells, so they can be cast while moving.
Everyone can use Sprint,
and some classes can use "gap-closers", jumps and dashes,
to move around more rapidly.
And melee classes can use True North
to get their positionals even when out of position.
All of these abilities have long cooldowns,
so you'll want to plan when to use them.

## Evaluating Your Performance ##

You can't learn or improve without feedback.
Merely practising a lot will not do you any good
unless you have some way of knowing what you're doing right,
and more importantly what you're doing wrong,
so you can take steps to fix these problems.
In the case of mechanics, you'll get pretty immediate feedback.
If you did it wrong, then you (or someone else) will probably be dead.
In the case of your rotation, however, feedback is less immediate.
This can be hard to assess during the fight itself.
In the heat of battle, many mistakes go unnoticed.
The only reliable way to evaluate your performance
is by using a tool called [ACT](https://advancedcombattracker.com/)
(Advanced Combat Tracker).
This basically records all the events that occur during a fight,
and then generates various useful statistics.
It can tell your DPS, or your HPS (Healing Per Second),
how much damage you took and from which attacks,
what buffs and debuffs you had at which times,
and so on.
These records, called "parses" or "logs",
can be uploaded to a website, [FFLogs](https://fflogs.com), 
which maintains a large database of logs.
You can use this to compare your own logs with those of other players on the same job.
There's another website, [xivanalysis.com](http://xivanalysis.com),
which provides automated job-specific feedback on logs.
I've found this to be helpfu,
but the feedback is fairly basic and generic.
You might gain more insight by carefully studying your own logs,
or by showing them to an expert.
(You need to be playing on PC to install ACT.
So if you're on PS4, it would be advisable to raid with a friend on PC
who can record your logs for you.)

I can't stress this enough:
if you want to be a serious raider, then ACT is an essential tool.
There is simply no other way to know how well you are performing.
You cannot merely rely on how things *seem* or *feel* to you during raids.
For example, when I first looked at my own logs,
it became glaringly obvious that I was hardly satisfying the ABC rule.
My CPM (Casts Per Minute) was much lower than it should have been.
Although it *felt* to me as if I was going flat out during the fight,
casting about as quickly as I possibly could,
my logs showed that there were actually lots small unnecessary gaps between my casts.
There were also periods where I stopped casting entirely,
presumably in order to focus on mechanics.
I hadn't even been aware that I was doing this.
Possessed with this knowledge, I was then able to focus on improving my CPM.
That's just one small example.
Even now, although I'm basically competent at my job,
when I look at my logs, I still see lots of mistakes and things I could improve.

(I should warn you that ACT is not officially endorsed by the game's developers,
Square Enix.
Strictly speaking, it contravenes the Terms and Conditions.
But, unofficially, they turn a "blind eye" to its use,
provided people do not use it to be "toxic" to other players.
I'd advise you to refrain from discussing parses in the in-game chat entirely,
otherwise you risk a ban.)

## Some Brief Advice for Healers ##

So far I've mainly only discussed DPS.
I've not said anything about the more specialised roles, tanks and healers.
Unfortunately, I'm not qualified to advise on tanking.
But, as a "healer main", I can give a few words of advice on this.

First, as noted above,
FFXIV is simply not designed for full-time healing.
Given the amount of damage that enemies do,
and the potency of your healing toolkit,
it is simply not necessary to spend all your time healing.
Optimal healing is about providing the necessary healing
in the most efficient way possible,
leaving as much time and resources to devote to doing damage.

Second, you have a variety of healing abilities in your toolkit.
These do different things and have different strengths and weaknesses.
Optimal healing is about using the right healing tool for the job.
As with your DPS rotation,
it's essential to understand all your healing abilities.
As a general rule, oGCD heals are better than GCD heals
(they are more potent and have less cost).
You should try to cover as much healing as possible with oGCDs.
But these have longer cooldowns and will not always be available
when healing is needed.
So you will sometimes have to resort to using GCDs.
Planning ahead can help you to ensure that you use your oGCDs
at the best times, to maximise their effectiveness.

Third, good healing is always *preemptive*.
You shouldn't simply be waiting for damage to happen
and then healing afterwards.
(This is true even for White Mages,
who are sometimes erroneously described as "reactive" healers.)
Rather, you should always be thinking ahead to what damage is coming next.
This determines how much healing you need to do now.
If your party is currently at low health
but will not take any more damage for another thirty seconds,
then there's no urgency to heal them up quickly.
In this situation it would be better to use a "regen" or "HoT"
(healing over time),
because these are more efficient,
in the sense that they provide more healing for less cost.
For this reason,
it is especially important for healers to know a raid inside out.
You need to know how much damage is coming and when,
so you can plan your healing accordingly.
Related to this,
it's important to get out of the mindset
of thinking that everyone needs to at 100% health at all times.
This just isn't true.
Players only need health in order to survive damage.
There are times when you know that a player will not be taking
any damage for a while.
So even if they are currently at low health,
healing them can wait until after you've attended to more important matters
(like doing DPS).

Fourth, healers need to be flexible.
Damage in raids can be divided into two categories.
First, there is *avoidable* damage,
which only affects players when they fail mechanics.
Second, there is *unavoidalbe* damage,
which affects players no matter what they do.
Unavoidable damage is very predictable,
and so it's advisable to work out a plan for healing this.
But avoidable damage is less predictable,
because it depends on players' actions.
Therefore, although it's good to have a healing plan,
you shouldn't stick too rigidly to it.
It's not acceptable to simply let people die
and then blame them for failing the mechanics.
Even if you're not the one at fault,
you will serve your party and yourself better
if you do what you can to keep them alive,
even if this means departing from your optimal healing plan.
As they say, "healers adjust".

## Group Coordination ##

The advice I've given so far is only about your own personal performance.
But raiding is essentially a *group* activity.
Success is about working together as a team.
In my view, this is a large part of what makes raiding so much fun.
When you start to feel comfortable with your own rotation,
you'll want to start thinking about ways in which you can synnergise
your abilities with those of other players in your party.
If you're a healer, you'll have a co-healer;
and if you're a tank, you'll have a co-tank.
Learning how to coordinate your healing or tanking with your partner
is another important aspect of successful raiding.
Many jobs have abilities which provide "raid buffs".
These may provide benefits for everyone in the party,
not just for the player who uses them.
Raids buffs are most effective when they are well coordinated.
So this provides another avenue for group coordination.
(Generally speaking, you can use your raid buffs "on cooldown".
Their cooldowns are such that they will natrually align with each other.)

I won't go into more detail here,
because some of these topics are too advanced for a beginners' guide.
The point I want to make is that,
because raiding is a group activity,
it can be much more enjoyable and rewarding in the context of a "static",
at least this has been the case in my own experience.
A static is simply a group of players who raid together on a regular basis.
Statics typically communicate with each other by voice chat (e.g. Discord)
while they are raiding.
This makes coordinating strategies and actions much easier.
Voice chat also enables players to "call out" the upcoming mechanics,
so it's less likely that one guy will forget what he's supposed to be doing.
And by playing with the same group of people regularly,
you can develop stable strategies.
You're not constantly having to start again from scratch.
Finally, being in a static has a nice social aspect to it as well.
Raiding needn't be super serious all the time.
You can have fun too.

Again, I don't want to insist that this is the only way to raid
or that it's right for everybody.
You may feel more comfortable going it alone with PUGs.
This is a completely viable approach too.
When it goes well,
it's pretty amazing how well a group of players can coordinate
with only minimal communication.
Unfortunately, it often doesn't go well.
So if you take the PUG route, you should be prepared
for a certain amount of frustration.

## Resources ##

The advice I've given above
barely scratches the surface of savage raiding.
Below I list a few useful online resources for further guidance.

- Perhaps the best resource is
  [The Balance](https://thebalanceffxiv.com/).
  This website provides guides to fights and jobs.
  It also has a link to The Balance discord server,
  which has channels devoted to different roles, jobs, and encounters.
  Here you can ask questions and get advice from experts.
  My own experience, mainly in the Scholar channels, has been very positive.
- My favourite FFXIV youtuber is
  [Momo Sama](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCeZs3jzn0qmnLAO3NWNt1g). 
  He has some amazing "healer optimisation" guides
  (which may be of interest even to non-healers,
  because they show the level of planning that the "pros" use).
  He also has "opener" guides for many other jobs.
- For raid guide videos
  [MTQCapture](https://www.youtube.com/user/MTQcapture) (Mizzteq)
  is pretty good,
  though you may find yourself in parties that don't use
  exactly the same strategies you see in these guides.
  (Also she has good puns.)
- At some point, you'll want to start thinking about your gear (and materia). 
  Guides to "BiS" (Best in Slot) gear sets for each job can be found in
  the appropriate channels on The Balance discord (see above).
  A useful tool for thinking about gear is
  [Ariyala's Final Fantasy XIV Toolkit](http://ffxiv.ariyala.com/).
- Helpful instructions for installing ACT are available
  [here](https://gist.github.com/TomRichter/e044a3dff5c50024cf514ffb20a201a9).
- You can admire your orange parses at [FFLogs](https://www.fflogs.com/),
  or see why they're grey at [xivanalysis.com](https://xivanalysis.com/).
